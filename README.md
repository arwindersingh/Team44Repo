## Website 

To briefly visualize the data and research we made, we use Django to design a simple website. 

Run the web application locally,

    python manage.py runserver # 127.0.0.1:8000

Django is a MVC framework, so we assign url to each page and initialize models for different parts.
For example, to create model for each part:

    python manage.py startapp tweet

After initialize the models, we create template for each pages and embeded the googel charts and maps inside the HTML file. 
And set corresponding route for each page.
